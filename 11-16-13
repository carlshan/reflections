Reflection

====

I was pretty satisfied with this week's turnout. Although there was a lack of other speakers, I think it was the right call to 
instead have Chris and Kristina focus the class on understanding various approaches towards estimating the parameters for the MDA model.

The presentation that Chris made and delivered was really high quality and I appreciate the time he put into crafting
such an informative and thorough presentation.

One point, however, is that not a lot of presenters were able to make it to class, and much of class seemed to have left early.
I wonder if enforcing attendance would have really made a difference? I know that Aaron's absence from class seemed to give the implicit excuse 
that other students didn't need to show up either.

Finally, I think that having class time devoted towards working sessions is a good idea! I felt like my group was productive enough
to have work done during the hr of class time we had.

I hope future weeks will emulate this past week.
