Reflections

=====

My reflections on this week are that it represented a pivot point in the entire process of the course. From meeting Aaron at Beta Lounge
to holding an intervention on Thursdya in class to turn the momentum in the class around, this past week was rather hectic and crazy.

But I'm glad that (a) Aaron was supportive of Sam and my actions and (b) the class starting getting behind our initiatives for 3 posters.

It's the last week of classes, so now is a do-or-die moment for us. 

Looking forward to the next 5 days.
