I'm amped up for working within my horizontal groups to tackle the problem of earthquake modeling; I finally feel like we're getting to 
the content of this course that I'm most excited about. Computationally modeling and building ways to accurately predict phenomena
is one of the most intriguing things that I believe will become more abundant as the world moves towards a tech and data driven world.

At the same time, I'm concerned that the we need some personal time with Professor Stark to coordinate understanding the math and underlying 
assumptions/questions behind the ETAS, Luen and other models that we should be benchmarking against. I don't know how much the instructors understand
the math or if we're able to get a great deal of Prof. Stark's time but I certainly hope that we'll be able to make something of the project regardless.

One point of feedback I have for the course is that I oftentimes feel like we run out of time because Aaron answers some minor questions in greater detail
than necessary. I distinctly remembering that on Tuesday, there were multiple points when someone asked questions to which Aaron could have either
(a) deflected to office hours/after class or (b) answered simply instead of taking much longer.

I remember Aaron mentioning during a demonstration of the standup that he'd only take the next 3 minutes to cover something. It took the next 20 minutes of class.
I think this course could be greatly improved if there was a clear outline of both the agenda and goals of each class. Otherwise, this course feels a bit lacking
in structure.
