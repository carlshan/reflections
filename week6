Topic: What are some of your reflections from the previous week?

Response:

I think the past week was a great improvement upon previous weeks. Having the plus/delta session for the first assignment,
and having the first assignment itself, felt very productive. I'm also glad that some feedback was given for our projects by 
the instructors as well as by our peers as well.

Overall, I definitely have a strong positive sense of where Stat 157 is going.
