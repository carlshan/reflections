Topic: What feedback would you give regarding the course so far?

Response:
I think the feedback in class covered a wide variety of different concerns raised by the students. Broadly speaking, it seems 
like most students had the following thoughts:

1. The course wasn't moving fast enough -- we're on week 4 and no assignments have been given, and no programming has occured
2. The course isn't focused enough on the data analytics & programming aspects of things -- students, when signing up, might have misunderstood
the perceived value of the course as focusing more on the programming and analytics than is actually being brought up in class
3. The focus on open research seems removed from most students daily lives
4. There is a lack of clarity of instructions relating to homework, assignments and instructions.

This was just some of the themes I perceived during the course feedback session on Thursday 10/26.
