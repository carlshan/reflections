Reflections on life, love and the pursuit of happiness (through the lens of Stat 157):

The semester is drawing to a close, and this week has been a losing of momentum for the course. Not only have I lost personal momentum
given the hectic past few weeks (job interviews, midterms, assignments, market research for a book, running my non-profit, hosting friends from South America)
but I also feel like the class itself is losing momentum. There's a lot of lost productivity that's resulting from more fragmentation and disorganization.

Part of that is a result of inaction on my part. I haven't been coordinating with the presenters on figuring out what the agenda for each day will look like. But
that's also a deliberate choice of mine. I do not wish to be the person in charge of figuring out what other people are doing in class. 
I'm happy that my personal group is hard at working at cracking the problem and that we've been able to make consistent progress.
