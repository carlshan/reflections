Reflections on the week:

It was a short week, so instead of commenting on course I'd rather discuss how our the meeting that our team (The Quakers) 
had this weekend was.

I feel incredibly grateful to have such a high-calibre and dedicated team. Each of my team members have been very hardworking, 
dedicated, motivated and sharp in analyzing the problems we're facing. The meeting ran very smoothly, with the problems being outlined,
the solutions being discussed and then the team being broken up into gropus to tackle each.

We were able to make massive headway in each of the obstacles we would face. Realizing how much my team could do really made me
feel grateful for having all of the teammates that I do.
