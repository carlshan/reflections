Week 2

Topic: What obstacles did you encounter? How did you go about fixing the problem? Who helped (people, links, etc)?


Response: 
I didn't encounter any problems, but I did spend time on Tuesday helping other students around the classroom fixing various issues they had with setting up their new virtual machine. I spent time (a) distributing a USB stick that contained the file to download (b) typing in relevant instructions into IRC and (c) going around the classroom asking if people needed help and trying to guide them through the necessary steps.
