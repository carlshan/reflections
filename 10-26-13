In reflection of this week, I wanted to note several things:
1. The nature of the assignments have gotten more and more interesting. I'm glad to be exercising my programming chops to accomplish interesting goals.

2. The fact that groups are allowed to be more fluid and self-formed is a good decision on the part of the facilitators. I think this is true because initial assigment to groups was largely arbitrary and some people didn't fit in the roles that they were assigned.

3. I'm not sure that imposing grades on the class will produce positive effects, and especially so late into the semester. It seems that this was something thought up halfway through the course, and announced too late. I would have preferred to have a consistent sense of the class structure, expectations and grading scheme (whether we're graded or not).

4. The final project seems intimidatingly open-ended. I'm worried that, like the rest of the class up to this point, the assignment is being kept deliberately ambiguous because even the instructors don't know what expectations to set. While this is fair, it's also unpleasantly stressful. I hope clear expectations can be set straight away.
