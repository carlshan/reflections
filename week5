Topic: What are some of your reflections from the previous week?


Response: 
I'm first of all really glad to hear about all the new activity that's going around on this assgiment. There's been a lot more 
stimulated discussion and coordination on this assignment which wasn't there before.

I also enjoyed finally getting my hands dirty with Python, iPython and R in this course. I'm really looking forward to programming and 
doing more cleaning.

Finally, I realized that a huge bulk of the work that was done for this assignment was around data cleaning and transformation rather than anything else.
The analysis feels like such a small portion of the overall work! But I guess this is reflected in the real world too; I've heard that
more work is done by data scientists to extract and clean the data than anything else.

I'm glad the leadership of the class was so responsive towards the feedback they got. Really appreciate that.

Carl
