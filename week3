Topic: What obstacles did you encounter? How did you go about fixing the problem? Who helped (people, links, etc)?

Response:
I had a great time today listening to the guest lectures on both predicting toad breeding likelihood as well as the issues
around earthquake prediction.

The one constructive reflection I would like to share with respect to Professor Stark's presentation was that there was a great deal
of material he attempted to cover in a very limited amount of time, and as a result we didn't even get to actually looking at 
the various potential models of earthquake prediction, or structuring exactly how our project will be delivered. There was a great deal of content
regarding how there are many flawed attempts at predicting, but I think the presentation should have outlined the steps that we would
be taking as a course to respond to these attempts more than just exploring the problems with previous approaches.
